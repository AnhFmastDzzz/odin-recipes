# odin-recipes

This is an HTML project about some random cooking recipes,
guided by the Odin Project.

I am planning to display some of my favorite cooking
recipes from my favortive anime show, which is foodwars.

Firstly, there would be a header for name of each recipe
then a list of igredients, and then how to make it.

I probably would add some gif image of the scence of 
making food process.

Lastly, there would be a small title congrats on finsihing the ingredients
and a gif and image of how the final dish would look like in anime
and prb real life too!

##Things I am going to learn and master more from the
project

In this project, I will use HTML tags like 
-head
-html root tag  to create the the stuff that do not display on my webpag but rather 
tells the browser the what type of HTML stuff i am gonna use

-paragraph
-link
-image
for the stuff that are going to be seen by users!!

Last but not least, I will get used more to doing git commit
and writting good commit message for each meaningful change to my code.
