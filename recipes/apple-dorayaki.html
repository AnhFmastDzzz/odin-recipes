        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Dorayaki is a dish made by Megumi Tadokoro in her match against Momo Akanegakubo during the 3rd Card of the 3rd Bout of the Rebels Vs. Central Régiment de Cuisine.</p>
        <p>By giving a spin on an 800-year-old classic Japanese dish with the help of Kojirō Shinomiya, Megumi enhanced the flavor of the apple with an apple butter castella and an apple confiture, white bean paste filling. The combined flavor of this dish is like a punch packed with twice the power!!!</p>
