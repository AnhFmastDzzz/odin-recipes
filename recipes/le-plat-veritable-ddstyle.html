        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            It is the dish that Erina Nakiri made as a main course after Yukihira Souma's appetiser dish "Time Fuse, Brazen Youngster-Style Primeval Meat", helped spreading the delicous flavor to maximum , with the help of Soma Yukihira, to lead the Rebels into beating Central and winning the seats of the Elite Ten Council. It is essentially a dish made up of all the disgusting snacks, like squid and peanut butter, but used to make a delicious dish. She also used the furikage seasoning from Season 1 that Soma used to get into Totsuki.
